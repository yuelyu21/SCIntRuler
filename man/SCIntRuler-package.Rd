\title{SCIntRuler: Integration of Single-Cell RNA-seq Datasets}
\description{
The SCIntRuler package addresses the challenges of integrating multiple
single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets. It provides tools to enhance
analytical robustness by augmenting sample sizes and reducing batch discrepancies.
Developed using the Seurat framework, SCIntRuler includes both existing and novel
workflows for single-cell analysis.
}
\section{Why SCIntRuler?}{

Integrating scRNA-seq datasets can be complex due to various factors such as
batch effects and sample diversity. SCIntRuler provides a statistical metric
to aid in crucial decisions regarding dataset integration, ensuring more
robust and accurate analyses.
